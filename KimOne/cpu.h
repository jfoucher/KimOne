/* Fake6502 CPU emulator core v1.1 *******************
 * (c)2011 Mike Chambers (miker00lz@gmail.com)       *
 *****************************************************
 * v1.1 - Small bugfix in BIT opcode, but it was the *
 *        difference between a few games in my NES   *
 *        emulator working and being broken!         *
 *        I went through the rest carefully again    *
 *        after fixing it just to make sure I didn't *
 *        have any other typos! (Dec. 17, 2011)      *
 *                                                   *
 * v1.0 - First release (Nov. 24, 2011)              *

 * public domain, but if you use it please do give   *

 *****************************************************
 * Fake6502 is a MOS Technology 6502 CPU emulation   *
 * engine in C. It was written as part of a Nintendo *
 * Entertainment System emulator I've been writing.  *
 *                                                   *
 * A couple important things to know about are two   *
 * defines in the code. One is "UNDOCUMENTED" which, *
 * when defined, allows Fake6502 to compile with     *
 * full support for the more predictable             *
 * undocumented instructions of the 6502. If it is   *
 * undefined, undocumented opcodes just act as NOPs. *
 *                                                   *
 * The other define is "NES_CPU", which causes the   *
 * code to compile without support for binary-coded  *
 * decimal (BCD) support for the ADC and SBC         *
 * opcodes. The Ricoh 2A03 CPU in the NES does not   *
 * support BCD, but is otherwise identical to the    *
 * standard MOS 6502. (Note that this define is      *
 * enabled in this file if you haven't changed it    *
 * yourself. If you're not emulating a NES, you      *
 * should comment it out.)                           *
 *                                                   *
 * If you do discover an error in timing accuracy,   *
 * or operation in general please e-mail me at the   *
 * address above so that I can fix it. Thank you!    *
 *                                                   *
 *****************************************************
 * Usage:                                            *
 *                                                   *
 * Fake6502 requires you to provide two external     *
 * functions:                                        *
 *                                                   *
 * uint8_t read6502(uint16_t address)                *
 * void write6502(uint16_t address, uint8_t value)   *
 *                                                   *
 * You may optionally pass Fake6502 the pointer to a *
 * function which you want to be called after every  *
 * emulated instruction. This function should be a   *
 * void with no parameters expected to be passed to  *
 * it.                                               *
 *                                                   *
 * This can be very useful. For example, in a NES    *
 * emulator, you check the number of clock ticks     *
 * that have passed so you can know when to handle   *
 * APU events.                                       *
 *                                                   *
 * To pass Fake6502 this pointer, use the            *
 * hookexternal(void *funcptr) function provided.    *
 *                                                   *
 * To disable the hook later, pass NULL to it.       *
 *****************************************************
 * Useful functions in this emulator:                *
 *                                                   *
 * void reset6502()                                  *
 *   - Call this once before you begin execution.    *
 *                                                   *
 * void exec6502(uint32_t tickcount)                 *
 *   - Execute 6502 code up to the next specified    *
 *     count of clock ticks.                         *
 *                                                   *
 * void step6502()                                   *
 *   - Execute a single instrution.                  *
 *                                                   *
 * void irq6502()                                    *
 *   - Trigger a hardware IRQ in the 6502 core.      *
 *                                                   *
 * void nmi6502()                                    *
 *   - Trigger an NMI in the 6502 core.              *
 *                                                   *
 * void hookexternal(void *funcptr)                  *
 *   - Pass a pointer to a void function taking no   *
 *     parameters. This will cause Fake6502 to call  *
 *     that function once after each emulated        *
 *     instruction.                                  *
 *                                                   *
 *****************************************************
 * Useful variables in this emulator:                *
 *                                                   *
 * uint32_t clockticks6502                           *
 *   - A running total of the emulated cycle count.  *
 *                                                   *
 * uint32_t instructions                             *
 *   - A running total of the total emulated         *
 *     instruction count. This is not related to     *
 *     clock cycle timing.                           *
